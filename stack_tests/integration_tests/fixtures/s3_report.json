The regulations mean that public sector bodies now have a legal obligation to meet accessibility requirements for their websites.</p>\n<p>To check how well the public sector are meeting the requirements, the Government Digital Service (part of the Cabinet Office) has been monitoring a sample of public sector websites.</p>\n<p>You’ve been sent this report because <a href=\"https://example.com\">https://example.com</a> is one of the websites we’ve monitored. This document explains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>which parts of your website we looked at</li>\n<li>how we checked the accessibility of those pages</li>\n<li>the accessibility issues found and how important they are</li>\n<li>what you need to do next to fix the issues</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps\">read more about the web accessibility regulations</a>.</p>\n    \n    \n    \n\n    <br />\n    <h2 id=\"report-section-2\">How accessible the website is</h2>\n    \n        <p>We checked <a href=\"https://example.com\">https://example.com</a> on 06 September 2022 against the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA</a> standard.</p>\n    \n    \n    \n\n    <br />\n    <h2 id=\"report-section-3\">How we checked</h2>\n    \n        <p>We use a mixture of simple manual checks and automated tests to find only the most common barriers to users with accessibility needs. We would expect your organisation to fully audit the website to find any other accessibility issues.</p>\n<p>Manual checks included using each page without a mouse, viewing the page at different zoom settings, and simulating viewing the page on a small screen.</p>\n<p>The automated tests were completed using the latest version of <a href=\"https://www.deque.com/axe/\">Axe</a>.</p>\n<p>Tests were completed using different settings in the Google Chrome browser on Mac OSX with a 15 inch screen.</p>\n    \n    \n    \n\n    <br />\n    <h2 id=\"report-section-4\">Pages we checked</h2>\n    \n        \n    \n    \n        <table id=\"urls-table\">\n    <caption class=\"govuk-visually-hidden\">Page name and URLs of the pages we checked</caption>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th id=\"name\">Page Name</th>\n            <th id=\"url\">URL</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        \n            <tr valign=\"top\" >\n                <td headers=\"name\"><p>Home</p></td>\n                <td headers=\"url\"><p><a href=\"https://example.com\">https://example.com</a></p></td>\n            </tr>\n        \n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n    \n    \n\n    <br />\n    <h2 id=\"report-section-5\">The issues we found</h2>\n    \n        <p>Only serious accessibility issues on the sample of pages we tested are listed in this report – these will cause problems for users with access needs when using your website. There are likely to be smaller errors which will make things more difficult for some users. You must carry out your own audit to find and fix issues on other pages.</p>\n    \n    \n    \n\n    <br />\n    <h2 id=\"report-section-6\">Home page issues</h2>\n    \n        <p><a href=\"https://example.com\">https://example.com</a></p>\n    \n    \n    \n        <table id=\"issues-table-6\">\n    <caption class=\"govuk-visually-hidden\">Names and URLs of pages we checked</caption>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th>#</th>\n            <th id=\"issue-6\">Issue and description</th>\n            <th id=\"where-found-6\">Where the issue was found</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        \n            <tr valign=\"top\">\n                <td><span class=\"govuk-visually-hidden\">Issue:</span>1</td>\n                <td headers=\"issue-1\"><p><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html\">WCAG 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a></p>\n<p>Poor colour contrast makes it difficult for someone with sight loss to see the content properly.

If accessibility issues remain after giving you time to fix them, the EHRC or ECNI may take further action.</p>\n<p>Public sector bodies must publish an accessibility statement and review it regularly. If the decision is taken that a public sector body has failed to publish an accessibility statement or that the accessibility statement is incorrect, the Minister for the Cabinet Office may publish the name of the body and a copy of the decision.</p>\n<p>The enforcement process can be found at <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps#how-the-accessibility-regulations-will-be-monitored-and-enforced\">https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps#how-the-accessibility-regulations-will-be-monitored-and-enforced</a>.</p>\n    \n    \n    \n\n    <br />\n    <h2 id=\"report-section-10\">Contact and more information</h2>\n    \n        <p>This test was conducted by the Government Digital Service on behalf of the Minister of the Cabinet Office as part of their obligations to monitor the accessibility of public sector websites in the United Kingdom.</p>\n<p>As the monitoring body we cannot offer specific advice on approaches or general accessibility queries other than questions directly related to the items in this report.</p>\n<p>Any questions about this report can be sent to <a href=\"mailto:accessibility-monitoring@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk\">accessibility-monitoring@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a>.</p>\n<p>Further information on guidance and tools for digital accessibility can be found at <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-and-tools-for-digital-accessibility\">https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-and-tools-for-digital-accessibility</a>.</p>\n<p>Help with accessibility auditing and publishing an accessibility statement can be found at <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/make-your-website-or-app-accessible-and-publish-an-accessibility-statement\">https://www.gov.uk/guidance/make-your-website-or-app-accessible-and-publish-an-accessibility-statement</a>.</p>\n    \n    \n    \n\n"
