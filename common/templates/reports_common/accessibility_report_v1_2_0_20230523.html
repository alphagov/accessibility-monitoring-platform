<h2 id="report-introduction" class="amp-new-page">Introduction</h2>
<p>
    Website accessibility regulations came into force on 23 September 2018.
    The regulations mean that public sector bodies now have a legal obligation to
    meet accessibility requirements for their websites.
</p>
<p>
    To check how well the public sector are meeting the requirements, the Government
    Digital Service (part of the Cabinet Office) has been monitoring a sample of
    public sector websites.
</p>
<p>
    You’ve been sent this report because
    <a href="{{ audit.case.home_page_url }}">{{ audit.case.home_page_url }}</a>
    is one of the websites we’ve monitored. This document explains:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>which parts of your website we looked at</li>
    <li>how we checked the accessibility of those pages</li>
    <li>the accessibility issues found and how important they are</li>
    <li>what you need to do next to fix the issues</li>
</ul>
<p>
    You can

<br />
<h2 id="report-how-accessible-the-website-is" class="amp-new-page">How accessible the website is</h2>
<p>
    We checked <a href="{{ audit.case.home_page_url }}">{{ audit.case.home_page_url }}</a> on
    {{ audit.date_of_test|date:"j F Y" }}
    against the
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA</a>
    standard.
</p>
<p>
    {% if audit.case.is_website_compliant == 'not-compliant' %}
        Based on our testing, this site is not compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA.
        This means there are some things which would cause significant barriers
        to users with certain accessibility needs.
    {% elif audit.case.is_website_compliant == 'partially-compliant' %}
        Based on our testing, this site is partially compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA.
        This means there are some things which are not fully accessible.
    {% elif audit.case.is_website_compliant == 'compliant' %}
        Based on our testing, this site is compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA.
        This means no serious or critical issues were found during our testing.
        We run basic tests on a small part of your website so we can't say for
        certain that your entire site will meet the regulations.
    {% endif %}
</p>

<br />
<h2 id="report-how-we-checked" class="amp-new-page">How we checked</h2>
<p>
    We use a mixture of simple manual checks and automated tests to find only
    the most common barriers to users with accessibility needs.
    We would expect your organisation to fully audit the website to find any
    other accessibility issues.
</p>
<p>
    Manual checks included using each page without a mouse, viewing the page at
    different zoom settings, and simulating viewing the page on a small screen.
</p>
<p>
    The automated tests were completed using the latest version of
    <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/">Axe</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Tests were completed using different settings in the Google Chrome browser
    on Mac OSX with a {{ audit.get_screen_size_display }} screen.

    Only serious accessibility issues on the sample of pages we tested are

    needs when using your website. There are likely to be smaller errors which
    will make things more difficult for some users. You must carry out your own
    audit to find and fix issues.

<p>
    It is a requirement of The Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile
    Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 that public sector
    websites are accessible.
</p>
<p>
    {% if audit.report_options_next == 'errors' %}
        You should fix the issues that were found and do your own accessibility
        audit to check for issues that go beyond the scope of simple
        accessibility testing.
    {% else %}
        You should do your own accessibility audit to check for issues that go beyond the scope of simple accessibility testing.
    {% endif %}
</p>
{% if audit.report_next_change_statement == 'yes' %}
    <p>
        You need to review your accessibility statement to cover the issues
        found in this report and any others found during your own audit.
    </p>
{% endif %}
{% if audit.report_next_no_statement == 'yes' %}
    <p>
        You need to write and publish an accessibility statement that meets the required legislative format.
    </p>
{% endif %}
{% if audit.report_next_statement_not_right == 'yes' %}
    <p>
        You need to review your accessibility statement to cover the issues
        found in this report, including ones related to your accessibility
        statement, and any other accessibility issues found during your own
        site audit.
    </p>
{% endif %}

{% if audit.report_next_statement_matches == 'yes' %}
    <p>
        You need to review your accessibility statement to cover any other
        issues found during your own audit.

{% endif %}

{% if audit.report_next_disproportionate_burden == 'yes' %}
    <p>
        A disproportionate burden assessment must have been completed before
        adding this section to your accessibility statement. You need to send
        evidence of the assessment to us for review.
    </p>

<br />
<h2 id="report-enforcement" class="amp-new-page">Enforcement</h2>
<p>
    On behalf of the Minister for the Cabinet Office we provide the
    {% if audit.case.enforcement_body == 'ehrc' %}
        Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)
    {% else %}
        Equality Commission for Northern Ireland (ECNI)
    {% endif %}
    with details about public sector bodies who have been monitored. If
    accessibility issues remain after giving you time to fix them, the
    {% if audit.case.enforcement_body == 'ehrc' %}
        EHRC
    {% else %}
        ECNI
    {% endif %}
    may take further action.
</p>
<p>
    Public sector bodies must publish an accessibility statement and review it
    regularly. If the decision is taken that a public sector body has failed to
    publish an accessibility statement or that the accessibility statement is
    incorrect, the Minister for the Cabinet Office may publish the name of the
    body and a copy of the decision.
