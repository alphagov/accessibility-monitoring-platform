Thank you for providing an update on progress since we sent you an accessibility report.
<br>
<br>
I have reviewed some of the issues we originally raised and the accessibility statement.

<h2>What happens next</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Accessibility Compliance</h3>
<br>
As part of our reporting process we provide the {{ case.get_enforcement_body_display }} ({{ case.enforcement_body|upper }})
with details about public sector bodies that are tested.
<br>
<br>
{% if case.recommendation_for_enforcement == 'no-further-action' %}
Based on the information you have provided we will be recommending to the {{ case.enforcement_body|upper }} that no further action is taken.
<br>
<br>
The {{ case.enforcement_body|upper }} has the right to overturn this recommendation. They will contact you if they need to take further action.
{% else %}
We will now pass on information regarding your {{ case.target_of_test }} to the {{ case.enforcement_body|upper }} so that they can decide if any further enforcement action is needed.
<br>
<br>
They may contact you directly if they think further action is needed.
{% endif %}
<br>
<br>
<h3>Accessibility Statement</h3>
<br>
On behalf of the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, we make a decision on the compliance of accessibility statements.
<br>
<br>
{% if case.retest_statement_compliance_state == 'compliant' or case.retest_ios_statement_compliance_state == 'compliant' and case.retest_android_statement_compliance_state == 'compliant' %}
We have determined that your statement is compliant.
<br>
<br>
{% else %}
{% if case.retest_statement_compliance_state == 'not-compliant' or case.retest_ios_statement_compliance_state == 'not-compliant' or case.retest_android_statement_compliance_state == 'not-compliant' %}
We have determined that your statement is not compliant.
<br>
<br>
{% elif case.retest_statement_compliance_state == 'no-statement' or case.retest_ios_statement_compliance_state == 'no-statement' or case.retest_android_statement_compliance_state == 'no-statement' %}
We were not able to find an accessibility statement and this does not comply with the requirement to publish a statement.
<br>
<br>
{% endif %}
Public sector bodies may request a review where they disagree with this decision. Any request for a review must be made in writing (via email) within 28 days of the decision and state the reason for the review. A list of websites without correct accessibility statements may be published by the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT).
{% endif %}
<br>
<br>
<h2>Future monitoring</h2>
<br>
Our monitoring is based on a sampling process. It is possible that your {{ case.target_of_test }}
may be put forward for further testing in the future. It is important that accessibility standards are maintained.
<br>
<br>
Many thanks,
<br>
<br>
