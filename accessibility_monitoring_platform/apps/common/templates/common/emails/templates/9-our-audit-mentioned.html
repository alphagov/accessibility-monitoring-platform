Dear {{ case.organisation_name }},
<br>
<br>
Thank you for updating your accessibility statement.
<br>
<br>
We notice that you have included the test we performed in your recent update.
While you are free to mention this, our test is not a full audit as it only covers
a subset of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and pages.
<br>
<br>
You should also have your own auditing process in place and mention this in your
statement.
<br>
<br>
Many thanks,
<br>
