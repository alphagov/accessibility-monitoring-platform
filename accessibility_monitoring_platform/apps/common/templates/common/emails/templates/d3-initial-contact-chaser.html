My name is {{ request.user.get_full_name }} from the accessibility monitoring team at Government Digital Service.
<br>
<br>
We initially emailed {{ case.organisation_name }} on <span class="amp-email-placeholder">(date of first email)</span> via <span class="amp-email-placeholder">(original email address)</span> about meeting the accessibility regulations.

<br>
<br>
We are following up as the initial 2 week deadline has passed for you to send information about your {{ case.target_of_test }}.

<br>
<br>
<span class="amp-email-placeholder">[Start: If we’ve had no response] ------------------------------------</span>
<br>
<br>
We are following up as we have not received any response from your organisation with information about your {{ case.target_of_test }}.
