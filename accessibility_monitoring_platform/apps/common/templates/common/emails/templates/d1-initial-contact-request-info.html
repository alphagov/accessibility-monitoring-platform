Dear {{ case.organisation_name }},
<br>
<br>
I am {{ request.user.get_full_name }} from the accessibility monitoring team at the Government Digital Service.
<br>
<br>
{% if case.is_complaint == 'yes' %}
We monitor the accessibility of public sector websites, digital services and mobile applications.
<br>
<br>
We have been referred a complaint from the {{ case.complaint_referrer_name }} who were contacted by a member of the public about your
{{ case.target_of_test }}.
They experienced accessibility issues, and it may not meet the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018
(<a href="https://gov.uk/accessibility-regulations">https://gov.uk/accessibility-regulations</a>).
As a result we need to complete a detailed accessibility audit.
{% elif case.previous_case_url %}
We are required to test a proportion of websites and mobile applications that we have previously tested. Your
{{ case.target_of_test }} was chosen from a random sample to be monitored again, using a detailed audit.
{% else %}
We monitor the accessibility of public sector websites, digital services and mobile applications. The
{{ case.target_of_test }}
{% if case.target_of_test == "website" %}
(<a href="{{ case.home_page_url }}">{{ case.home_page_url}}</a>)
{% endif %}
was chosen from a random sample to be monitored using a detailed audit.
{% endif %}
<br>
<br>
It is a requirement of The Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 that public sector websites and mobile applications are accessible to everyone.
<br>
<br>
<h2>What you have to do</h2>
<br>
Under the Regulations your {{ case.target_of_test }}
must meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.2 AA standards) and we require further information.
<br>
<br>
We are asking that you provide us with the following:
<br>
<br>
{% if case.test_type == 'mobile' %}
<ul>
<li>A short overview of the application and any other information you think is relevant, for example a previous accessibility audit</li>
<li>A summary of the main user journeys through the app</li>
<li>Examples of different template styles used across the app</li>
<li>Contact details for iOS and Android app teams</li>
</ul>
{% elif case.target_of_test == 'service' %}
<ul>
<li>[AWAITING NEW TEXT]</li>
</ul>
{% else %}
<ul>
<li>A short overview of the website and any other information you think is relevant, for example a previous accessibility audit</li>
<li>Analytics on the most popular pages, forms and services</li>
<li>Examples of different templates used across the website</li>
