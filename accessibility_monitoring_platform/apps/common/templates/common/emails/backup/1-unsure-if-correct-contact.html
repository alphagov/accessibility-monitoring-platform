Dear <span class="amp-email-placeholder">............</span>,
<br>
<br>
I am {{ case.auditor.get_full_name }} from the website accessibility monitoring team at the Government Digital Service.
<br>
<br>
We have been given the role to monitor the accessibility of public sector websites. Your website was chosen from a random sample to be monitored.
<br>
<br>
It is a requirement of <a href="https://gov.uk/accessibility-regulations">The Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018</a> that public sector websites are accessible to everyone. This came into force on 23 September 2018.
<br>
<br>
<h2>What we found</h2>
We found some accessibility issues with the website.
<br>
<br>
Please can you email us at
<a href="mailto:accessibility-monitoring@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">accessibility-monitoring@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a>
to provide us with the email address of the person or team who are responsible for your website.
<br>
<br>
Many thanks,
<br>
