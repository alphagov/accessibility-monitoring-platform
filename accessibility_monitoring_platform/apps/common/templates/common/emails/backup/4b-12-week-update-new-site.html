Dear {{ case.organisation_name }},
<br>
<br>
We emailed you an accessibility report on {{ case.report_sent_date|amp_date }} with a deadline of {{ case.report_followup_week_12_due_date }}. to review the accessibility of {{ case.domain }} and fix any issues.
<br>
<br>
You informed us that you were replacing the site we tested.
<br>
<br>
Please provide an update on your progress including whether the new site is live or your timelines for the new site going live.
<br>
<br>
We will check your accessibility statement to check that it meets the accessibility regulations.
<br>
<br>
All information will be passed to the {{ case.get_enforcement_body_display }} ({{ case.enforcement_body|upper }}) for further action and a list of websites without correct accessibility statements will be published by the Cabinet Office.
<br>
