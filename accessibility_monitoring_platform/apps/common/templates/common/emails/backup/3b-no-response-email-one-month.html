Dear <span class="amp-email-placeholder">(team responsible for the website)</span>
<br>
<br>
We recently sent you an email about meeting website accessibility regulations.
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps">https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps</a>
<br>
<br>
We tried to contact you on <span class="amp-email-placeholder">(provide date of initial contact email)</span>. We then attempted to contact you again on <span class="amp-email-placeholder">(provide date of 7 day no contact email)</span>. On both occasions we got no response.
<br>
<br>
Please respond within the next 7 days.
<br>
<br>
We look forward to receiving your response soon.
<br>
<br>
Many thanks
