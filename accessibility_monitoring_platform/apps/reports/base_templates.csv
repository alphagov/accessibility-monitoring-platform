To check how well the public sector are meeting the requirements, the Central Digital and Data Office (part of the Cabinet Office) has been monitoring a sample of public sector websites.

You’ve been sent this report because [{{ audit.case.home_page_url }}]({{audit.case.home_page_url }}) is one of the websites we’ve monitored. This document explains:

* which parts of your website we looked at
* how we checked the accessibility of those pages
* the accessibility issues found and how important they are
* what you need to do next to fix the issues

{% if audit.case.is_website_compliant == 'not-compliant' %}
Based on our testing, this site is not compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA. This means there are some things which would cause significant barriers to users with certain accessibility needs.
{% elif audit.case.is_website_compliant == 'partially-compliant' %}
Based on our testing, this site is partially compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA. This means there are some things which are not fully accessible.
{% elif audit.case.is_website_compliant == 'compliant' %}
Based on our testing, this site is compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA. This means no serious or critical issues were found during our testing. We run basic tests on a small part of your website so we can't say for certain that your entire site will meet the regulations.

Manual checks included using each page without a mouse, viewing the page at different zoom settings, and simulating viewing the page on a small screen.

The automated tests were completed using the latest version of axe: [https://www.deque.com/axe/](https://www.deque.com/axe/).

Tests were completed using different settings in the Google Chrome browser on Mac OSX with a {{ audit.get_screen_size_display }} screen.",3

If accessibility issues remain after giving you time to fix them, the EHRC or ECNI may take further action.

Public sector bodies must publish an accessibility statement and review it regularly. If the decision is taken that a public sector body has failed to publish an accessibility statement or that the accessibility statement is incorrect, the Minister for the Cabinet Office may publish the name of the body and a copy of the decision.
