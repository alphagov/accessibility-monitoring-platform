2,pdf,WCAG 2.4.2 Page titled,,https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/page-titled.html,"PDF documents should have titles that describe the topic or purpose of the page. Titles help users understand the topic without having to read the entire document.

Without a descriptive title a user may need to spend time searching the document to decide whether the content is relevant.

When a PDF is displayed in a browser the title will usually be displayed in the top title bar or as the tab name."
3,pdf,WCAG 3.1.1 Language of Page,,https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/language-of-page.html,"Assistive technologies are more accurate when a document has a specified language.

8,manual,WCAG 2.1.2 No Keyboard Traps,There is a keyboard trap,https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/no-keyboard-trap.html,"If you can focus on an element using a keyboard then you must also be able to move away from that element using the keyboard. If an element has been designed to keep focus, make sure the user knows how to ‘untrap’ the focus.

This ensures content does not ‘trap’ keyboard focus. It can be a problem with embedded content such as twitter feeds."
9,manual,WCAG 2.4.7 Focus Visible,No or barely visible focus,https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-visible.html,"A visible focus helps users know which element has keyboard focus and where they are on the page.

When an element gets focus there should be a visible border around it. Highlighting the element that has keyboard focus or is hovered over can provide information like whether the element is interactive or the scope of that element.

Operating systems have a native indication of focus, which is available in many browsers. The default display of the focus indicator is not always highly visible and may even be difficult to see especially on coloured backgrounds."

It also helps users who are viewing the page on a mobile device.

If a page does not support reflow it can appear smaller and more difficult to use or content may be cut off.

Navigation menus often collapse into fewer items or into a single menu button to take up less space. All content and functionality must still be fully available."

When information is presented with audio or video only there should be an alternative way to give the same information.

An example of video only is a silent movie or animation which may contain captions but no audio. Podcasts are an example of audio only. A transcript, text alternative or audio-description of the content are other ways to allow sight or hearing impaired users to access the content."
13,manual,WCAG 1.2.2 Captions (prerecorded),Quick check for captions (pre Sept 2020 exempt),https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/captions-prerecorded.html,"When videos have no captions, users who are deaf or have hearing impairments will have limited or no access to the audio information.

14,manual,WCAG 1.4.5 Images of Text,Significant content is within an image of text,https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/images-of-text.html,"Images of text cause problems for users who need to adjust how visual content like font size, spacing or colours are displayed. The image quality can reduce and become blurry when users increase page magnification.

Images of text should not be used unless text cannot be formatted to the same effect, for example logos or branding. Text may be used in images where the text is part of an image that contains a lot of other visual content like graphs or diagrams that give important information through more than just text."
15,manual,"WCAG 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide","For animations, videos and carousels",https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pause-stop-hide.html,"Content that moves, flashes or updates automatically can be a severe distraction for certain users, making it difficult to use the page. It can also cause problems for assistive technologies like screen readers.

For any moving, flashing or scrolling information that:

* starts automatically,
* lasts more than five seconds, and
* is presented in parallel with other content

there should be a way for the user to pause, stop or hide it, unless it is part of an essential activity.

There must be a method to allow the user to pause, stop, hide or control the frequency for content that automatically begins ‘auto-updating’ in parallel with other content unless it is essential to an activity."
16,manual,WCAG 1.4.2 Audio Control,No way to control audio that plays for >3 seconds,https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/audio-control.html,"Audio which plays automatically on a page can be distracting and make it difficult for screenreader users to hear the content being read out.

If audio plays automatically for more than 3 seconds there must be a way of

* pausing,
* stopping, or
* controlling the audio volume independently from the overall system volume."
17,manual,WCAG 1.4.3 Contrast (minimum),Severe issues in image of text,https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html,Poor colour contrast makes it difficult for someone with sight loss to see the content properly.

This functionality may not show on mobile devices.

If using this functionality to display extra content, the following must be true:

* There should be a way of dismissing the content without changing the hover or focus - unless the content communicates an input error or does not obscure or replace other content
* If content is triggered on pointer hover, the pointer must be able to be moved over the content without disappearing
* The content must remain visible until the hover or focus is removed, the user dismisses it, or the information is no longer valid"
19,manual,WCAG 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable,The page refreshes unexpectedly,https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/timing-adjustable.html,"Users do not expect pages to refresh automatically. Refreshing can be disorientating for users of assistive technology who may not have time to read the page before it refreshes and focus moves back to the top of the page.

There must be an option to turn off, extend or adjust the timing of page refreshes except if the time limit is:

* a required part of a real-time event
* essential and extending it would invalidate the activity
* longer than 20 hours"
20,manual,WCAG 2.4.3 Focus Order,Only if severe,https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-order.html,"Users should be able to navigate a web page in an order that makes sense. Keyboard navigation should reflect a navigation sequence that is consistent with the meaning of content. Logical navigation reduces confusion and shows logical relationships between content and components.

The focus order may differ from the visual reading order as long as a user can still understand the web page without sight."
21,manual,WCAG 3.2.1 On Focus,Unexpected actions when tabbing,https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/on-focus.html,"The functionality of a page should be predictable as a user moves through it. Any component that is able to trigger an event when it gets focus must not change the context.

This helps users with visual, cognitive and motor impairments by reducing the potential for disorientation caused by changing context.

For example, when a component gets focus:

* forms should not submit automatically
* new windows should not open
* focus should not change to another component"
